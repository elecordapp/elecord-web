**Elecord-Web**  
Last updated: December 20th, 2024

Elecord-Web will be referred to as "the app" throughout this document.  
"We", "us", and similar terms refer to the developers of Elecord-Web.  
"You", "the user", and similar terms refer to anyone using Elecord-Web.

### **Understanding Your Privacy and Data Usage**

The app is a client for the Matrix protocol, designed with privacy and decentralization in mind. The app itself does not host or manage user data but connects users to their chosen Matrix homeserver. Because Matrix is a federated system, the handling of your data depends primarily on the homeserver and services you choose to interact with.

Elecord's primary concern always has been, and always will be user privacy.

### **Homeservers and Federation**
- The app allows you to connect to any Matrix-compliant homeserver. The homeserver you select governs how your data is handled and stored. You must review and accept the privacy policy of your chosen homeserver before using the app.  
- Messages, files, and metadata shared in federated rooms may be replicated across all participating homeservers. If these homeservers are operated by third parties, their respective privacy policies will apply.  
- Federated homeservers may reside in different countries and be subject to local laws and regulations.

### **User-Generated Content**
The app enables communication with other Matrix users through:
- Text messages
- Images
- Videos
- Audio files
- Files and documents
- Location sharing (both static and live)

Such messages and attachments are only sent upon user action, indicating the user's wish to share this data with other users.

### **Bridging**
Some Matrix rooms may include integrations with third-party platforms (e.g., IRC, email, or social media). Data shared in such rooms may be transmitted to these external services. Once shared, the app cannot guarantee the ability to manage or delete this data. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective bridged platforms for more information.

### **Identity Services**
Users may utilize identity servers to map personal identifiers (e.g., email or phone numbers) to their Matrix ID. The app does not provide or manage identity services. If you choose to use an identity server, its privacy policy will govern how your data is handled.

### **Voice and Video Calls**
For voice and video calls, the app may use:
- **Element Call:** For multi-user calls, the app connects to Element Call servers. The homeserver or participants may suggest specific Element Call servers. Review the privacy policy of the respective server operator for details.

### **Local Data Storage**
The app may cache limited data on the user's device to optimize performance:
- For web use, IndexedDB is utilized for local storage.  
- This data is only accessible locally and is not shared without user consent.

### **Encryption**
- All communication between the app and Matrix servers uses TLS encryption to ensure secure data transmission.  
- End-to-end encryption is supported for private chats, depending on the configuration of the homeserver and the preferences of the user.

### **Cloudflare Services**
The web version of the app is hosted using Cloudflare. Cloudflare may process limited data to ensure secure and efficient delivery of the app. Please review [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details.

### **Third-Party Integrations**
Users may interact with bots, widgets, or other third-party integrations in Matrix rooms. These integrations have access to the messages and files in rooms where they are active. Please review the privacy policies of the respective integration providers for further details.

### **Data Deletion and Account Deactivation**
The app does not store user data independently. To delete your data or deactivate your account, contact your homeserver operator. Federated homeservers may retain replicated data, and some Matrix clients or homeservers may not honor deletion requests fully.

### **Children's Privacy**
The app does not knowingly collect or process data from individuals under the age of 16. If you are under 16, do not use the app.

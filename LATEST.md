## 2.2.0 - 2025-03-06

**elecord v2.2.0** is a feature release, bringing with it the long overdue elecord desktop app. Installing the desktop app means you'll continue to get automatic updates, but also enhanced functionality. Being able to search messages and browse files inside your private end-to-end encrypted rooms.

Also added in this release is a new changelog tab (which you can quickly access via the bottom left version button) showing you all the new changes in one place. Plus, there are lots of visual improvements and theme changes, to give you an even more enjoyable, and more user friendly experience.

Outside of the app, you can now find the apps website, with a newly created roadmap: [elecord.app](https://elecord.app)
